== Angular Library

`Angular CLI` provides us with methods that allow the creation of a library. After that, using either packet manager (`npm` or `yarn`) the library can be build and packed which will allow later to install/publish it.

== Whats a library?

From link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)[wikipedia]: a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications.

== How to build a library

In this section, a library is going to be build step by step. 

=== Creating an empty application

First, using `Angular CLI` we are going to generate a empty application which will be later filled with the generated library. In order to do so, `Angular CLI` allows us to add to `ng new "application-name"` an option (`--create-application`). This option is going to tell `Angular CLI` not to create the initial `app` project. This is convenient since a library is going to be generated in later steps. Using this command `ng new "application-name" --create-application=false` an empty project with the name wanted is created.


[source]
----
ng new "application-name" --create-application=false
----

=== Generating a library

After generating an empty application, a library is going to be generated. Inside the folder of the project, the `Angular CLI` command `ng generate library "library-name"` is going to generate the library as a project (`projects/"library-name"`). As an addition, the option `--prefix="library-prefix-wanted"` allows us to switch the default prefix that Angular generated with (`lib`). Using the option to change the prefix the command will look like this `ng generate library "library-name" --prefix="library-prefix-wanted"`.

[source]
----
ng generate library "library-name" --prefix="library-prefix-wanted"
----

=== Generating/Modifying in our library

In the last step we generated a library. This generates automaticly a `module`,`service` and `component` inside (`projects/"library-name"`) that we can modify adding new methods, components etc that we want to use in other projects. We can generate other elements, using the usual `Angular CLI` generate commands adding the option `--project="library-name"` is going to allow to generate elements within our project . An example of this is: `ng generate service "name" --project="library-name"`.

[source]
----
ng generate "element" "name" --project="library-name"
----

=== Exporting the generated things

Inside the library (`projects/"library-name`) theres a `public_api.ts` which is the file that exports the elements inside the library. In case we generated other things, that file needs to be modified adding the extra exports with the generated elements. In addition, changing the library version is possible in the file `package.json`.

=== Building our library

Once we added the necessary exports, in order to use the library in other applications, we need to build the library. The command `ng build "library-name"` is going to build the library, generating in `"project-name"/dist/"library-name"` the necessary files.

[source]
----
ng build "library-name"
----

[[id-packing-library]]
=== Packing the library

In this step we are going to pack the build library. In order to do so, we need to go inside `dist/"library-name"` and then run either `npm pack` or `yarn pack` to generate a `"library-name-version.tgz"` file.

.Packing using npm
[source]
----
npm pack
----

.Packing using yarn
[source]
----
yarn pack
----

=== Publishing to npm repository (optional)

* Add a _README.md_ and _LICENSE_ file. The text inside _README.md_ will be used in you npm package web page as documentation.

* run `npm adduser` if you do not have a npm account to create it, otherwise run `npm login` and introduce your credentials.

* run `npm publish` inside `dist/"library-name"` folder.

* Check that the library is published: https://npmjs.com/package/library-name


=== Installing our library in other projects

In this step we are going to install/add the library on other projects.

==== npm 

In order to add the library in other applications, there are two ways:

    * *Option 1*: From inside the application where the library is going to get used, using the command `npm install "path-to-tgz"/"library-name-version.tgz"` allows us to install the `.tgz` generated in <<id-packing-library>>.

    * *Option 2*: run `npm install "library-name"` to install it from npm repository.

==== yarn

To add the package using yarn:

    * *Option 1*: From inside the application where the library is going to get used, using the command `yarn add "path-to-tgz"/"library-name-version.tgz"` allows us to install the `.tgz`  generated in <<id-packing-library>>.

    * *Option 2*: run `yarn add "library-name"` to install it from npm repository.

=== Using the library

Finally, once the library was installed with either packet manager, you can start using the elements from inside like they would be used in a normal element inside the application. Example `app.component.ts`:

[source, TypeScript]
----
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { MyLibraryService } from 'my-library';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

  toUpper: string;

  constructor(private myLibraryService: MyLibraryService) {}
  title = 'devon4ng library test';
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.toUpper = this.myLibraryService.firstLetterToUpper('test');
  }
}
----

Example `app.component.html`:

[source, TypeScript]
----
<!--The content below is only a placeholder and can be replaced.-->
<div style="text-align:center">
  <h1>
    Welcome to {{ title }}!
  </h1>
  <img width="300" alt="Angular Logo" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNTAgMjUwIj4KICAgIDxwYXRoIGZpbGw9IiNERDAwMzEiIGQ9Ik0xMjUgMzBMMzEuOSA2My4ybDE0LjIgMTIzLjFMMTI1IDIzMGw3OC45LTQzLjcgMTQuMi0xMjMuMXoiIC8+CiAgICA8cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjQzMwMDJGIiBkPSJNMTI1IDMwdjIyLjItLjFWMjMwbDc4LjktNDMuNyAxNC4yLTEyMy4xTDEyNSAzMHoiIC8+CiAgICA8cGF0aCAgZmlsbD0iI0ZGRkZGRiIgZD0iTTEyNSA1Mi4xTDY2LjggMTgyLjZoMjEuN2wxMS43LTI5LjJoNDkuNGwxMS43IDI5LjJIMTgzTDEyNSA1Mi4xem0xNyA4My4zaC0zNGwxNy00MC45IDE3IDQwLjl6IiAvPgogIDwvc3ZnPg==">
</div>
<h2>Here is my library service being used: {{toUpper}}</h2>
<lib-my-library></lib-my-library>
----

Example `app.module.ts`:

[source, TypeScript]
----
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

import { MyLibraryModule } from 'my-library';
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    MyLibraryModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
----

=== devon4ng libraries

In https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-library[devonfw/devon4ng-library] you can find some useful libraries:

* *Authorization module*: This devon4ng Angular module adds rights-based authorization to your Angular app.

* *Cache module*: Use this devon4ng Angular module when you want to cache requests to server. You may configure it to store in cache only the requests you need and to set the duration you want.
